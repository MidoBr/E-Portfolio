										<h2>Collaborative Learning Discussion 1 - Summary Post </h2>
									</header>
									
									<p>In my initial post, the discussion was about how medical devices are vulnerable to cyber threats and vulnerabilities, the focus was on medical training devices, particularly mannequin systems. As mentioned, these devices are connected to the internet through a wireless connection, which made them vulnerable to Denial of service attack in which affects the availability of the system, as well as brute force attack which might give the malicious actor unauthorized access to the system. Some solutions were displayed to mitigate such threats, including cryptography, examining the packet header’s value or using statistical measures to observe the number of packets.
My colleague Mathew Van Beek, discussed the reason behind these kinds of attacks, which is to acquire PHI and PII by people who do not have legitimate access to this information. The recommendation of fixing laws to be followed by manufacturers to maintain security perhaps help mitigating security issues, bearing in mind it will increase the financial costs for the manufacturers what might affect some other aspect of their business. A very interesting question was raised, “How would you prevent the Wi-Fi of the medical device from been breached?” (Mathew, 2021)
A direct answer to the question is a set of tips provided by the cybersecurity and infrastructure security agency (CISA), some of these recommendations is to encrypt data on the network, restrict access for only authorized users, installing firewalls and changing the default password. (CISA, 2020). 
My colleague and group member Gurkan Huray brought an interesting topic to the table, Medical internet of things devices (MIoT) and how to secure it. Briefly, the internet of things includes human-machine interaction and machine to machine interaction, Al-Sarawi et al. 2017 mentioned that the communication protocols used in IoT have the mechanisms of encryption and authentication, they all use the advanced encryption standard (AES), this indicates that the MIoT using the same standards as a strong secure communicating protocol.</p>
