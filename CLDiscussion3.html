<p>
  In my initial post, I displayed a case study of disclosing CCTV footage from a direct provision centre. The complainant claimed that his photos were leaked to a radio program, which is considered a violation of data protection law under the GDPR. My fellow peers made some outstanding responses, stating their comments on such a case.

According to Nasim (2021), “the public demand in North America, bodies that enforce and deliver data protection laws, as well as a legislative body of government such as Parliament, are the main causes behind the absence of data protection law enforcement”. In such situations, countries are encouraged to set their own data protection laws to secure their citizen’s privacy rights.  

Shota (2021) referenced the information security management standards Also known as (ISMS) in ISO27001, as well as the Payment Card Industry Data Security (PCI DSS) to support the idea of maintaining policies and procedures. The ISMS and PCI DSS recommend organizations keep their policies updated regularly. From another perspective, the ISMS ISO27001 recommends in A.7.2.2 to carry out training and awareness programs. (ISO, 2013).

 Mathew (2021) raised an interesting question related to the Facebook situation and whether it is relevant to this case study. The introduction paragraph was focusing on Facebook data exposure as an example of a confidentiality element that was violated in our case study. In some way, data privacy falls under the confidentiality concept in which should be accessible only to authorized people.

(Coss & Samonas, 2014), stated and I Quote “Confidentiality is a primary tenet of information security which has its roots grounded in the military mindset of maintaining a top-down authority and control over those that have access to information, on a need to know basis”.
